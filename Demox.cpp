/*
In simple terms, a namespace in C++ is like 
a CONTAINER that holds 
a set of identifiers—such as variables,
 functions, and classes—under a unique name. 
 This helps to avoid naming conflicts,
  especially in large 
 projects or when using multiple libraries 
 that may have functions or variables with the 
 same names.
